## Future changes
I would like to make the projects into an image that has a drop down of details keeping screen easy to read but with deeper content exploration.
The words could be revised to fit my life and resume plus giving clearer flow through page and getting rid of any redundant information.
The email could also connect to my personal infomration. Unless the other version then forms has different info then that will be as learned.
